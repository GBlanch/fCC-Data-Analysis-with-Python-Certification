## Summary

In this course, I learnt the fundamentals of Data Analysis with Python. From loading and cleaning flat files with Pandas to performing mathematical operations and statistical analysis with Numpy, I also created diverse visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn. <br> Note that instead of using Replit, I developed, debugged and validated the python modules for each problem using VS Code in my local machine.

## Problems


  - ### [Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](https://github.com/GBlanch/fCC-Data-Analysis-with-Python-Certification/tree/main/0.mvsd_calc)
  - ### [Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/GBlanch/fCC-Data-Analysis-with-Python-Certification/tree/main/1.demographic_analyzer)
  - ### [Medical Data Visualizer](https://github.com/GBlanch/fCC-Data-Analysis-with-Python-Certification/tree/main/2.med_data_visual)
  - ### [Page View Time Series Visualizer](https://github.com/GBlanch/fCC-Data-Analysis-with-Python-Certification/tree/main/3.page_time_series_visual)
  - ### [Sea Level Predictor](https://github.com/GBlanch/fCC-Data-Analysis-with-Python-Certification/blob/main/4.sea_level_predictor)
<br>

## How to test these


  1. For each project, download the `py files` (x3) from their respective py files folders and also the csv files when these exist.
  2. Save them all in the same directory/folder.
  3. Open a terminal in VS Code - or any other IDE - and run the `main.py` file ("python main.py")
