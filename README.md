## Summary

Good foundational hands-on knowledge of Data Analysis from the course [freeCodeCamp - Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/)


## Projects:

  - **[Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](https://github.com/GBlanch/fCC-Data-Analysis-with-Python-Certification/tree/main/0.mvsd_calc)**
  - **[Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/GBlanch/fCC-Data-Analysis-with-Python-Certification/tree/main/1.demographic_analyzer)**
  - **[Medical Data Visualizer](https://github.com/GBlanch/fCC-Data-Analysis-with-Python-Certification/tree/main/2.med_data_visual)**
  - **[Page View Time Series Visualizer](https://github.com/GBlanch/fCC-Data-Analysis-with-Python-Certification/tree/main/3.page_time_series_visual)**
  - **[Sea Level Predictor](https://github.com/GBlanch/fCC-Data-Analysis-with-Python-Certification/blob/main/4.sea_level_predictor)**

## How to test these:

  1. For each project, download the `py files` (x3) in their respective py files folders and also the csv files.
  2. Save them all in the same directory/folder.
  3. Open a terminal in VS Code - or any other IDE - and run the `main.py` file ("python main.py")
